TSIA201 - WAVELETS AND FILTERBANKS LAB
Guillaume Capitan & Baptiste Moalic

You can find our code :
	• either on a Jupyter notebook : Code_Wavelets_Filterbanks_Lab.ipynb
	• or on Spyder (on which we did our lab) : Code_Spyder_version.py

Our written answers + the graphs plotted can be found on the pdf : Answers_Wavelets_Filterbanks_Lab.pdf

Finally, as the graphs appear quite small on the notebook and the pdf, you can find them in higher
resolution in the folder "GRAPHS".
